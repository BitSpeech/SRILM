DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Word posterior lattices and meshes are lattices  generated
       by aligning N-best hypotheses with nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee(1).  They
       compactly encode possible word  hypotheses  sequences  and
       their  posterior  probabilities.  (Word meshes have become
       generally   known    as    ``confusion    networks''    or
       ``sausages.'')

       A  word lattice is a partially ordered directed graph with
       nodes representing word hypotheses.  Nodes are  identified
       by  non-negative  integers.  The file format specifies the
       initial node _i, the final node _f, and any number of  addi-
       tional  nodes _n.  For each node _n the following associated
       information is given on the same line: the word identity _w
       (the  string  ``NULL''  is  used  with  initial  and final
       nodes), the alignment position _a (identical values in this
       field  identify  hypotheses  that  occur at the same posi-
       tion), and the word posterior  probability  _p.   Following
       these  values, zero or more transitions to successor nodes
       are specified, each given by the node  index  _n_i  and  the
       transition  posterior  probability _p_i.  In a properly nor-
       malized word lattice the transition posteriors _p_i  sum  up
       to the node posterior _p.

       Word meshes represent a more constrained lattice format in
       which word hypotheses are in a total order.  A  mesh  con-
       tains  a number of alignment positions, and a set of mutu-
       ally exclusive  word  hypotheses  in  each  position  (the
       ``confusion  sets'').   The  word mesh represents all sen-
       tence hypotheses that can be generated by freely combining
       word  hypotheses at each position.  The file format speci-
       fies the number of alignment positions  _A  and  the  total
       posterior  probability  mass  _P  contained in the lattice,
       followed by one or confusion set specifications.  For each
       alignment  position _a, the hypothesized words _w_i and their
       posterior probabilities _p_i are listed in alternation.  The
       pseudo-word  string  **DDEELLEETTEE** represents an empty hypothe-
       sis.

       Optionally, the word mesh format encodes additional infor-
       mation  about  the  hypothesis  alignment  from  which  it
       resulted.  The keyword  rreeffeerreennccee  specifies  the  correct
       word  _w  that was aligned at position _a.  The keyword hhyyppss
       is used to list the sentence hypotheses of which a certain
       word  hypothesis was a part.  The word hypothesis is iden-
       tified by an alignment postion _a and the  word  string  _w,
       and  is  followed by the integer IDs _h_i (typically, the N-
       best ranks) of the associated sentence hypotheses.

       As another optional element, the  word  mesh  can  contain
       word-level  acoustic  and  temporal information, following
       the keyword iinnffoo, the alignment position _a, and  the  word
       identity  _w.   This  information  is derived by nnbbeesstt--llaatt--
       ttiiccee(1) from word- and phone-level  backtraces  of  N-best
       hypotheses  (as  represented in Decipher NBestList2.0 for-
       mat).  The details of this information are defined in  the
       SRILM  class NNBBeessttWWoorrddIInnffoo and subject to change, but cur-
       rently include the following.  _s_t_a_r_t: word start time  (in
       seconds  from  the  beginning  of the waveform); _d_u_r: word
       duration (in seconds); _a_s_c_o_r_e: acoustic  model  likelihood
       (log  base  10);  _g_s_c_o_r_e:  grammar  (LM and pronunciation)
       score (log base 10); _p_h_o_n_e_s: sequence of  phones  in  word
       (separated by colons); _p_h_o_n_e_d_u_r_s: sequence phone durations
       (in numbers of frames, separated by  colons).   NNoottee::  The
       encoded  information  pertains to the word hypothesis with
       the  highest  per-unit-time  acoustic  score   among   all
       hypotheses  of  the same word aligned to a given word mesh
       position.

       Word lattices and meshes can be converted to  PFSG  format
       using the script wwllaatt--ttoo--ppffssgg.

       Detailed alignment and acoustic information is so far only
       implemented for  word  meshes,  although  conceptually  it
       would apply equally to word lattices.
