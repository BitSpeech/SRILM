ngram - apply N-gram language models
<H2> SYNOPSIS </H2>
<B> ngram </B>
[<B>-help</B>]<B></B>
option
...
<H2> DESCRIPTION </H2>
<B> ngram </B>
performs various operations with N-gram-based and related language models,
including sentence scoring, perplexity computation, sentences generation,
and various types of model interpolation.
The N-gram language models are read from files in ARPA
<A HREF="ngram-format.html">ngram-format(5)</A>;
various extended language model formats are described with the options
below.
<H2> OPTIONS </H2>
<P>
Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a 
compressed file (name ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate
stdin/stdout.
<DL>
<DT><B> -help </B>
<DD>
Print option summary.
<DT><B> -version </B>
<DD>
Print version information.
<DT><B>-order</B><I> n</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set the maximal N-gram order to be used, by default 3.
NOTE: The order of the model is not set automatically when a model
file is read, so the same file can be used at various orders.
To use models of order higher than 3 it is always necessary to specify this
option.
<DT><B>-debug</B><I> level</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set the debugging output level (0 means no debugging output).
Debugging messages are sent to stderr, with the exception of 
<B> -ppl </B>
output as explained below.
<DT><B> -memuse </B>
<DD>
Print memory usage statistics for the LM.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
The following options determine the type of LM to be used.
<DL>
<DT><B> -null </B>
<DD>
Use a `null' LM as the main model (one that gives probability 1 to all words).
This is useful in combination with mixture creation or for debugging.
<DT><B>-lm</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Read the (main) N-gram model from
<I>file</I>.<I></I>
This option is always required, unless 
<B> -null </B>
was chosen.
<DT><B> -tagged </B>
<DD>
Interpret the LM as containing word/tag N-grams.
<DT><B> -skip </B>
<DD>
Interpret the LM as a ``skip'' N-gram model.
<DT><B>-hidden-vocab</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Interpret the LM as an N-gram model containing hidden events between words.
The list of hidden event tags is read from
<I>file</I>.<I></I>
<BR>
Hidden event definitions may also follow the N-gram definitions in 
the LM file (the argument to 
<B>-lm</B>).<B></B>
The format for such definitions is
<BR>
	<I>event</I>
[<B>-delete</B> <I>D</I>]
[<B>-repeat</B> <I>R</I>]
[<B>-insert</B> <I>w</I>]
[<B>-observed</B>]
[<B>-omit</B>]
<BR>
The optional flags after the event name modify the default behavior of 
hidden events in the model.
By default events are unobserved pseudo-words of which at most one can occur
between regular words, and which are added to the context to predict
following words and events.
(A typical use would be to model hidden sentence boundaries.)
<B> -delete </B>
indicates that upon encountering the event,
<I> D </I>
words are deleted from the next word's context.
<B> -repeat </B>
indicates that after the event the next
<I> R </I>
words from the context are to be repeated.
<B> -insert </B>
specifies that an (unobserved) word 
<I> w </I>
is to be inserted into the history.
<B> -observed </B>
specifies the event tag is not hidden, but observed in the word stream.
<B> -omit </B>
indicates that the event tag itself is not to be added to the history for
predicting the following words.
<BR>
The hidden event mechanism represents a generalization of the disfluency
LM enabled by 
<B>-df</B>.<B></B>
<DT><B>-hidden-not</B><I></I><B></B>
<DD>
Modifies processing of hidden event N-grams for the case that 
the event tags are embedded in the word stream, as opposed to inferred 
through dynamic programming.
<DT><B> -df </B>
<DD>
Interpret the LM as containing disfluency events.
This enables an older form of hidden-event LM used in
Stolcke &amp; Shriberg (1996).
It is roughly equivalent to a hidden-event LM with
<BR>
	UH -observed -omit		(filled pause)
<BR>
	UM -observed -omit		(filled pause)
<BR>
	@SDEL -insert &lt;s&gt;		(sentence restart)
<BR>
	@DEL1 -delete 1 -omit	(1-word deletion)
<BR>
	@DEL2 -delete 2 -omit	(2-word deletion)
<BR>
	@REP1 -repeat 1 -omit	(1-word repetition)
<BR>
	@REP2 -repeat 2 -omit	(2-word repetition)
<DT><B>-classes</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Interpret the LM as an N-gram over word classes.
The expansions of the classes are given in
<I>file</I><I></I>
in 
<A HREF="classes-format.html">classes-format(5)</A>.
Tokens in the LM that are not defined as classes in
<I> file </I>
are assumed to be plain words, so that the LM can contain mixed N-grams over
both words and word classes.
<BR>
Class definitions may also follow the N-gram definitions in the 
LM file (the argument to 
<B>-lm</B>).<B></B>
In that case 
<B>-classes /dev/null</B><B></B>
should be specified to trigger interpretation of the LM as a class-based model.
Otherwise, class definitions specified with this option override any
definitions found in the LM file itself.
<DT><B>-simple-classes</B><B></B>
<DD>
Assume a "simple" class model: each word is member of at most one word class,
and class expansions are exactly one word long.
<DT><B>-expand-classes</B><I> k</I><B></B>
<DD>
Replace the read class-N-gram model with an (approximately) equivalent
word-based N-gram.
The argument
<I> k </I>
limits the length of the N-grams included in the new model
(<I>k</I>=0<I></I>
allows N-grams of arbitrary length).
<DT><B>-expand-exact</B><I> k</I><B></B>
<DD>
Use a more exact (but also more expensive) algorithm to compute the 
conditional probabilities of N-grams expanded from classes, for
N-grams of length
<I> k </I>
or longer
(<I>k</I>=0<I></I>
is a special case and the default, it disables the exact algorithm for all
N-grams).
The exact algorithm is recommended for class-N-gram models that contain
multi-word class expansions, for N-gram lengths exceeding the order of 
the underlying class N-grams.
<DT><B> -decipher </B>
<DD>
Use the N-gram model exactly as the Decipher(TM) recognizer would,
i.e., choosing the backoff path if it has a higher probability than
the bigram transition, and rounding log probabilities to bytelog
precision.
<DT><B> -factored </B>
<DD>
Use a factored N-gram model, i.e., a model that represents words as 
vectors of feature-value pairs and models sequences of words by a set of 
conditional dependency relations between factors.
Individual dependencies are modeled by standard N-gram LMs, allowing
however for a generalized backoff mechanism to combine multiple backoff
paths (Bilmes and Kirchhoff 2003).
The 
<B>-lm</B>,<B></B>
<B>-mix-lm</B>,<B></B>
etc. options name FLM specification files in the format described in
Kirchhoff et al. (2002).
<DT><B> -hmm </B>
<DD>
Use an HMM of N-grams language model.
The 
<B> -lm </B>
option specifies a file that describes a probabilistic graph, with each
line corresponding to a node or state.
A line has the format:
<BR>
	<I>statename</I> <I>ngram-file</I> <I>s1</I> <I>p1</I> <I>s2</I> <I>p2</I> ...
<BR>
where 
<I> statename </I>
is a string identifying the state,
<I> ngram-file </I>
names a file containing a backoff N-gram model,
<I>s1</I>,<I>s2</I>
... are names of follow-states, and 
<I>p1</I>,<I>p2</I>
... are the associated transition probabilities.
A filename of ``-'' can be used to indicate the N-gram model data
is included in the HMM file, after the current line.
(Further HMM states may be specified after the N-gram data.)
<BR>
The names
<B> INITIAL </B>
and
<B> FINAL </B>
denote the start and end states, respectively, and have no associated
N-gram model (<I> ngram-file </I>
must be specified as ``.'' for these).
The 
<B> -order </B>
option specifies the maximal N-gram length in the component models.
<BR>
The semantics of an HMM of N-grams is as follows: as each state is visited,
words are emitted from the associated N-gram model.
The first state (corresponding to the start-of-sentence) is
<B>INITIAL</B>.<B></B>
A state is left with the probability of the end-of-sentence token
in the respective model, and the next state is chosen according to
the state transition probabilities.
Each state has to emit at least one word.
The actual end-of-sentence is emitted if and only if the
<B> FINAL </B>
state is reached.
Each word probability is conditioned on all preceding words, regardless 
of whether they were emitted in the same or a previous state.
<DT><B>-vocab</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Initialize the vocabulary for the LM from
<I>file</I>.<I></I>
This is especially useful if the LM itself does not specify a complete
vocabulary, e.g., as with
<B>-null</B>.<B></B>
<DT><B>-nonevents</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Read a list of words from
<I> file </I>
that are to be considered non-events, i.e., that
should only occur in LM contexts, but not as predictions.
Such words are excluded from sentence generation
(<B>-gen</B>)
and
probability summation
(<B>-ppl -debug 3</B>).
<DT><B> -limit-vocab </B>
<DD>
Discard LM parameters on reading that do not pertain to the words 
specified in the vocabulary.
The default is that words used in the LM are automatically added to the 
vocabulary.
This option can be used to reduce the memory requirements for large LMs 
that are going to be evaluated only on a small vocabulary subset.
<DT><B> -unk </B>
<DD>
Indicates that the LM contains the unknown word, i.e., is an open-class LM.
<DT><B>-map-unk</B><I> word</I><B></B>
<DD>
Map out-of-vocabulary words to 
<I>word</I>,<I></I>
rather than the default
<B> &lt;unk&gt; </B>
tag.
<DT><B> -tolower </B>
<DD>
Map all vocabulary to lowercase.
Useful if case conventions for text/counts and language model differ.
<DT><B> -multiwords </B>
<DD>
Split input words consisting of multiwords joined by underscores
into their components, before evaluating LM probabilities.
<DT><B>-mix-lm</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Read a second N-gram model for interpolation purposes.
The second and any additional interpolated models can also be class N-grams
(using the same
<B> -classes </B>
definitions), but are otherwise constrained to be standard N-grams, i.e.,
the options
<B>-df</B>,<B></B>
<B>-tagged</B>,<B></B>
<B>-skip</B>,<B></B>
and
<B> -hidden-vocab </B>
do not apply to them.
<BR>
<B> NOTE: </B>
Unless 
<B> -bayes </B>
(see below) is specified,
<B> -mix-lm </B>
triggers a static interpolation of the models in memory.
In most cases a more efficient, dynamic interpolation is sufficient, requested
by 
<B>-bayes 0</B>.<B></B>
Also, mixing models of different type (e.g., word-based and class-based)
will
<I> only </I>
work correctly with dynamic interpolation.
<DT><B>-lambda</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set the weight of the main model when interpolating with
<B>-mix-lm</B>.<B></B>
Default value is 0.5.
<DT><B>-mix-lm2</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lm3</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lm4</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lm5</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lm6</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lm7</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lm8</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lm9</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Up to 9 more N-gram models can be specified for interpolation.
<DT><B>-mix-lambda2</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lambda3</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lambda4</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lambda5</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lambda6</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lambda7</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lambda8</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
<DT><B>-mix-lambda9</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
These are the weights for the additional mixture components, corresponding
to
<B> -mix-lm2 </B>
through
<B>-mix-lm9</B>.<B></B>
The weight for the
<B> -mix-lm </B>
model is 1 minus the sum of 
<B> -lambda </B>
and 
<B> -mix-lambda2 </B>
through
<B>-mix-lambda9</B>.<B></B>
<DT><B> -loglinear-mix </B>
<DD>
Implement a log-linear (rather than linear) mixture LM, using the 
parameters above.
<DT><B>-bayes</B><I> length</I><B></B>
<DD>
Interpolate the second and the main model using posterior probabilities
for local N-gram-contexts of length
<I>length</I>.<I></I>
The 
<B> -lambda </B>
value is used as a prior mixture weight in this case.
<DT><B>-bayes-scale</B><I> scale</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set the exponential scale factor on the context likelihood in conjunction
with the
<B> -bayes </B>
function.
Default value is 1.0.
<DT><B>-cache</B><I> length</I><B></B>
<DD>
Interpolate the main LM (or the one resulting from operations above) with
a unigram cache language model based on a history of
<I> length </I>
words.
<DT><B>-cache-lambda</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set interpolation weight for the cache LM.
Default value is 0.05.
<DT><B>-dynamic</B><I></I><B></B>
<DD>
Interpolate the main LM (or the one resulting from operations above) with
a dynamically changing LM.
LM changes are indicated by the tag ``&lt;LMstate&gt;'' starting a line in the
input to
<B>-ppl</B>,<B></B>
<B>-counts</B>,<B></B>
or
<B>-rescore</B>,<B></B>
followed by a filename containing the new LM.
<DT><B>-dynamic-lambda</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set interpolation weight for the dynamic LM.
Default value is 0.05.
<DT><B>-adapt-marginals</B><I> LM</I><B></B>
<DD>
Use an LM obtained by adapting the unigram marginals to the values specified
in the
<I> LM </I>
in
<A HREF="ngram-format.html">ngram-format(5)</A>,
using the method described in Kneser et al. (1997).
The LM to be adapted is that constructed according to the other options.
<DT><B>-base-marginals</B><I> LM</I><B></B>
<DD>
Specify the baseline unigram marginals in a separate file 
<I>LM</I>,<I></I>
which must be in
<A HREF="ngram-format.html">ngram-format(5)</A>
as well.
If not specified, the baseline marginals are taken from the model to be
adapted, but this might not be desirable, e.g., when Kneser-Ney smoothing
was used.
<DT><B>-adapt-marginals-beta</B><I> B</I><B></B>
<DD>
The exponential weight given to the ratio between adapted and baseline
marginals.
The default is 0.5.
<DT><B>-adapt-marginals-ratios</B><I></I><B></B>
<DD>
Compute and output only the log ratio between the adapted and the baseline
LM probabilities.
These can be useful as a separate knowledge source in N-best rescoring.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
The following options specify the operations performed on/with the LM
constructed as per the options above.
<DL>
<DT><B> -renorm </B>
<DD>
Renormalize the main model by recomputing backoff weights for the given
probabilities.
<DT><B>-prune</B><I> threshold</I><B></B>
<DD>
Prune N-gram probabilities if their removal causes (training set)
perplexity of the model to increase by less than
<I> threshold </I>
relative.
<DT><B> -prune-lowprobs </B>
<DD>
Prune N-gram probabilities that are lower than the corresponding
backed-off estimates.
This generates N-gram models that can be correctly
converted into probabilistic finite-state networks.
<DT><B>-minprune</B><I> n</I><B></B>
<DD>
Only prune N-grams of length at least
<I>n</I>.<I></I>
The default (and minimum allowed value) is 2, i.e., only unigrams are excluded
from pruning.
This option applies to both
<B> -prune </B>
and
<B>-prune-lowprobs</B>.<B></B>
<DT><B>-rescore-ngram</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Read an N-gram LM from 
<I> file </I>
and recompute its N-gram probabilities using the LM specified by the
other options; then renormalize and evaluate the resulting new N-gram LM.
<DT><B>-write-lm</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Write a model back to
<I>file</I>.<I></I>
The output will be in the same format as read by
<B>-lm</B>,<B></B>
except if operations such as 
<B> -mix-lm </B>
or 
<B> -expand-classes </B>
were applied, in which case the output will contain the generated
single N-gram backoff model in ARPA
<A HREF="ngram-format.html">ngram-format(5)</A>.
<DT><B>-write-vocab</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Write the LM's vocabulary to
<I>file</I>.<I></I>
<DT><B>-gen</B><I> number</I><B></B>
<DD>
Generate
<I> number </I>
random sentences from the LM.
<DT><B>-seed</B><I> value</I><B></B>
<DD>
Initialize the random number generator used for sentence generation
using seed
<I>value</I>.<I></I>
The default is to use a seed that should be close to unique for each
invocation of the program.
<DT><B>-ppl</B><I> textfile</I><B></B>
<DD>
Compute sentence scores (log probabilities) and perplexities from
the sentences in
<I>textfile</I>,<I></I>
which should contain one sentence per line.
The
<B> -debug </B>
option controls the level of detail printed, even though output is
to stdout (not stderr).
<DT><B> -debug 0 </B>
<DD>
Only summary statistics for the entire corpus are printed,
as well a partial statistics for each input portion delimited by 
escaped lines (see
<B>-escape</B>).<B></B>
These statistics include the number of sentences, words, out-of-vocabulary
words and zero-probability tokens in the input,
as well as its total log probability and perplexity.
Perplexity is given with two different normalizations: counting all
input tokens (``ppl'') and excluding end-of-sentence tags (``ppl1'').
<DT><B> -debug 1 </B>
<DD>
Statistics for individual sentences are printed.
<DT><B> -debug 2 </B>
<DD>
Probabilities for each word, plus LM-dependent details about backoff
used etc., are printed.
<DT><B> -debug 3 </B>
<DD>
Probabilities for all words are summed in each context, and
the sum is printed.
If this differs significantly from 1, a warning message
to stderr will be issued.
<DT><B>-nbest</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Read an N-best list in
<A HREF="nbest-format.html">nbest-format(5)</A>
and rerank the hypotheses using the specified LM.
The reordered N-best list is written to stdout.
If the N-best list is given in
``NBestList1.0'' format and contains 
composite acoustic/language model scores, then
<B> -decipher-lm </B>
and the recognizer language model and word transition weights (see below)
need to be specified so the original acoustic scores can be recovered.
<DT><B>-nbest-files</B><I> filelist</I><B></B>
<DD>
Process multiple N-best lists whose filenames are listed in
<I>filelist</I>.<I></I>
<DT><B>-write-nbest-dir</B><I> dir</I><B></B>
<DD>
Deposit rescored N-best lists into directory 
<I>dir</I>,<I></I>
using filenames derived from the input ones.
<DT><B> -decipher-nbest </B>
<DD>
Output rescored N-best lists in Decipher 1.0 format, rather than 
SRILM format.
<DT><B> -no-reorder </B>
<DD>
Output rescored N-best lists without sorting the hypotheses by their
new combined scores.
<DT><B> -split-multiwords </B>
<DD>
Split multiwords into their components when reading N-best lists;
the rescored N-best lists thus no longer contain multiwords.
(Note this is different from the
<B> -multiwords </B>
option, which leaves the input word stream unchanged and splits
multiwords only for the purpose of LM probability computation.)
<DT><B>-max-nbest</B><I> n</I><B></B>
<DD>
Limits the number of hypotheses read from an N-best list.
Only the first
<I> n </I>
hypotheses are processed.
<DT><B>-rescore</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Similar to
<B>-nbest</B>,<B></B>
but the input is processed as a stream of N-best hypotheses (without header).
The output consists of the rescored hypotheses in
SRILM format (the third of the formats described in
<A HREF="nbest-format.html">nbest-format(5)</A>).
<DT><B>-decipher-lm</B><I> model-file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Designates the N-gram backoff model (typically a bigram) that was used by the
Decipher(TM) recognizer in computing composite scores for the hypotheses fed to
<B> -rescore </B>
or
<B>-nbest</B>.<B></B>
Used to compute acoustic scores from the composite scores.
<DT><B>-decipher-order</B><I> N</I><B></B>
<DD>
Specifies the order of the Decipher N-gram model used (default is 2).
<DT><B> -decipher-nobackoff </B>
<DD>
Indicates that the Decipher N-gram model does not contain backoff nodes,
i.e., all recognizer LM scores are correct up to rounding. 
<DT><B>-decipher-lmw</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
Specifies the language model weight used by the recognizer.
Used to compute acoustic scores from the composite scores.
<DT><B>-decipher-wtw</B><I> weight</I><B></B>
<DD>
Specifies the word transition weight used by the recognizer.
Used to compute acoustic scores from the composite scores.
<DT><B>-escape</B><I> string</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set an ``escape string'' for the
<B>-ppl</B>,<B></B>
<B>-counts</B>,<B></B>
and
<B> -rescore </B>
computations.
Input lines starting with
<I> string </I>
are not processed as sentences and passed unchanged to stdout instead.
This allows associated information to be passed to scoring scripts etc.
<DT><B>-counts</B><I> countsfile</I><B></B>
<DD>
Perform a computation similar to 
<B>-ppl</B>,<B></B>
but based only on the N-gram counts found in 
<I>countsfile</I>.<I></I>
Probabilities are computed for the last word of each N-gram, using the
other words as contexts, and scaling by the associated N-gram count.
Summary statistics are output at the end, as well as before each
escaped input line.
<DT><B>-count-order</B><I> n</I><B></B>
<DD>
Use only counts of order
<I> n </I>
in the
<B>-counts</B><B></B>
computation.
The default value is 0, meaning use all counts.
<DT><B> -counts-entropy </B>
<DD>
Weight the log probabilities for 
<B> -counts </B>
processing by the join probabilities of the N-grams.
This effectively computes the sum over p(w,h) log p(w|h),
i.e., the entropy of the model.
In debugging mode, both the conditional log probabilities and the 
corresponding joint probabilities are output.
<DT><B> -skipoovs </B>
<DD>
Instruct the LM to skip over contexts that contain out-of-vocabulary
words, instead of using a backoff strategy in these cases.
<DT><B>-noise</B><I> noise-tag</I><B></B>
<DD>
Designate
<I> noise-tag </I>
as a vocabulary item that is to be ignored by the LM.
(This is typically used to identify a noise marker.)
Note that the LM specified by
<B> -decipher-lm </B>
does NOT ignore this
<I> noise-tag </I>
since the DECIPHER recognizer treats noise as a regular word.
<DT><B>-noise-vocab</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Read several noise tags from
<I>file</I>,<I></I>
instead of, or in addition to, the single noise tag specified by
<B>-noise</B>.<B></B>
<DT><B> -reverse </B>

Reverse the words in a sentence for LM scoring purposes.
(This assumes the LM used is a ``right-to-left'' model.)
Note that the LM specified by
<B> -decipher-lm </B>
is always applied to the original, left-to-right word sequence.

<H2> BUGS </H2>
Some LM types (such as Bayes-interpolated and factored LMs) currently do
not support the 
<B> -write-lm </B>
function.
<P>
For the 
<B> -limit-vocab </B>
option to work correctly with hidden event and class N-gram LMs, the
event/class vocabularies have to be specified by options (<B> -hidden-vocab </B>
and
<B>-classes</B>,<B></B>
respectively).
Embedding event/class definitions in the LM file only will not work correctly.
<P>
Sentence generation is slow and takes time proportional to the vocabulary
size.
<P>
The file given by 
<B> -classes </B>
is read multiple times if
<B> -limit-vocab </B>
is in effect or if a mixture of LMs if specified.
This will lead to incorrect behavior if the argument of
<B> -classes </B>
is stdin (``-'').
<P>
Also, 
<B> -limit-vocab </B>
will not work correctly with LM operations that require the entire
vocabulary to be enumerated, such as 
<B> -adapt-marginals </B>
or perplexity computation with
<B>-debug 3</B>.<B></B>
<P>
Support for factored LMs is experimental and many LM operations supported
by standard N-grams (such as
<B>-limit-vocab</B>)<B></B>
are not implemented yet.
