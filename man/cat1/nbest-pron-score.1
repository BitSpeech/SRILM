       nnbbeesstt--pprroonn--ssccoorree reads N-best lists and computes log prob-
       ability scores for the pronunciations and pauses contained
       in them.  Pronunciation scoring requires that  the  N-best
       lists  contain  phone  backtraces in "NBestList2.0" nnbbeesstt--
       ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       Pronunciation scores are computed from  the  probabilities
       in  a  dictionary.   Pauses  are  binned into three length
       classes (none, short, long) and scored according to a tri-
       gram  language  model  that conditions the pause length on
       the left and right neighboring words, in  that  order  (so
       that bigram backoff uses the left neighbor only).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Controls  the  amount  of  output  (the  higher the
              _l_e_v_e_l, the more).

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map all vocabulary to lowercase.   Useful  if  case
              conventions for text/counts and language model dif-
              fer.

       --mmuullttiiwwoorrddss
              Deal with N-best lists containing multiwords joined
              by  underscores.   This only affects pause scoring:
              if a word adjacent to a pause is a multiword and is
              not  in  the vocabulary of the pause LM, then it is
              split and only the component closest to  the  pause
              is conditioned on.

       --nnbbeesstt _f_i_l_e
              Score the N-best hypothese in _f_i_l_e.

       --rreessccoorree _f_i_l_e
              Same as --nnbbeesstt.

       --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess _f_i_l_e
              Process all N-best list filenames listed in _f_i_l_e.

       --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt _n
              Limits the number of hypotheses read from an N-best
              list.  Only the first _n hypotheses are processed.

       --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy _f_i_l_e
              Enable pronunciation scoring, using the  pronuncia-
              tion dictionary _f_i_l_e.  Each line contains a pronun-
              ciation in the format
                   _w_o_r_d [_p] _p_h_o_n_e ...
              The optional value _p is the pronunciation probabil-
              ity.  If the second field in a line is not a number
              the pronunciation is assumed  to  have  probability
              one.

       --iinnttllooggss
              Interpret  probabilities  in the dictionary as int-
              log-scaled log probabilities (as used  in  the  SRI
              Decipher(TM)  system),  rather than straight proba-
              bilities.

       --ppaauussee--llmm _f_i_l_e
              Enable pause scoring, using the pause LM in _f_i_l_e.

       --nnoo--ppaauussee _t_a_g
              The word used to represent the absence of  a  pause
              in the pause LM.

       --sshhoorrtt--ppaauussee _t_a_g
              The  word  used  to  represent a short pause in the
              pause LM.

       --lloonngg--ppaauussee _t_a_g
              The word used to represent  a  long  pause  in  the
              pause LM.

       --mmiinn--ppaauussee--dduurr _T
              The  minimum duration, in seconds, for a non-speech
              region to be considered a (short) pause.

       --lloonngg--ppaauussee--dduurr _T
              The duration, in second, above which  a  non-speech
              region is considered a "long" pause.

       The  default values for pause tags and duration thresholds
       are printed by the --hheellpp option.

       --pprroonn--ssccoorree--ddiirr _d_i_r
              Write pronunciation scores to _d_i_r  when  processing
              multiple   N-best  lists,  using  output  filenames
              derived from the input files.

       --ppaauussee--ssccoorree--ddiirr _d_i_r
              Write pause scores to _d_i_r when processing  multiple
              N-best  lists,  using output filenames derived from
              the input files.
